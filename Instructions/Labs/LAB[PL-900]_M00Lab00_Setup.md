Module 0: Course introduction
=================================

## Lab: Validate lab environment

Scenario
--------

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on campus. Campus visitors are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently, and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus.

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus.

In this Module 0 lab, you will acquire a Power Platform trial tenant and access the Power Platform admin center. In the admin center, we will create an individual environment for configuration during the course.

Exercise 1 – Acquire your Power Platform trial tenant 
------------------------------------------

1. Copy your **Microsoft 365 credentials** from the Authorized Lab Hoster.

2. Navigate to <https://powerapps.microsoft.com> and click **Start free.**

3. Under **Get started**, enter the email address from your Microsoft 365 credentials in the text box that says **Enter your work email address.**

4. You see a prompt that you have an existing account with Microsoft. Select **Sign in.**

5. Enter the password provided by the Authorized Lab Hoster. 

6. Select **Yes** to stay signed in.


Exercise 2 - Create your environment 
------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will create your **Practice** environment that you will do the majority of your lab work in.

### Task 1 – Create environment

1.  Access <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your Microsoft 365 credentials if prompted again.

2. Select **Environments** and click **+New.**

    - For **Name**, enter **[My Initials] Practice.** (Example: AJ Practice.)
    
    - For **Type**, select **Trial** (do not select the Trial (subscription-based) option).
    
    - Change the toggle on **Create a database for this environment?** to **Yes.**
    
    - Leave all other selections as default and click **Next.**
    
    - On the next tab, leave all selections to default and click **Save.**

3. Your **Practice** environment should now show in the list of Environments. 

4. Your environment may take a few minutes to provision. Refresh the page if needed. When your environment is prepared, select your **Practice** environment by clicking on the ellipses next to its name to expand the drop down menu and select **Settings.** 

5.  Explore the different areas in **Settings** that you are interested in, but do not make any changes yet.

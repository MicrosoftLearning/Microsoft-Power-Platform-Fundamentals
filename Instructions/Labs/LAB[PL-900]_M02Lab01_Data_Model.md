# Module 2: Introduction to Common Data Service
## Lab 1: Introduction to Common Data Service


# Scenario

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on campus. Campus visits are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently, and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus. 

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus. 

In this lab, you will access your Practice environment from the previous lab, create a Common Data Service (CDS) database, and create a solution to track your changes. You will also create a data model to support the following requirements:

-   R1 – Track the locations (buildings) of the campus visits
-   R2 – Record basic information to identify and track the visitors 
-   R3 – Schedule, record, and manage visits 

Finally, you will import sample data into Common Data Service.

# High-level lab steps

To prepare your learning environments you will:

* create a solution and publisher
* add both new and existing components required to meet the application requirements. Refer to the [data model document](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/PL-900-Microsoft-Power-Platform-Fundamentals/raw/master/Allfiles/Labs/Campus%20Management.png) for the metadata description (entities and relationships). You can hold CTRL+click or right click the link to open the data model document in a new window.

Your solution will contain several entities upon completion of all the customizations:

-   Contact
-   Building
-   Visit

## Prerequisites:

* Completion of **Module 0 Lab 0 - Validate lab environment**

## Things to consider before you begin:

* Naming convention

* Data types, restrictions (e.g. max length of a name)

* Datetime formatting to support easy localization

* Record the characters before the "@" symbol in your email address - it should be a first name and a last initial. These characters will become your "alias" throughout the course. Write them down somewhere you will be able to access throughout the course. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, workflows, etc. you create.

# Challenges

* Would you consider using *appointment* activity as part of the solution? What would it change?
* How could you enforce the scheduled end to be after the scheduled start? 
* How could you add support for multiple meetings during a single visit?
* How could you secure the building access not only for external contacts but for internal staff member as well?
* How could you make visits to certain buildings require management approval? What would the approval process change in the data model?
